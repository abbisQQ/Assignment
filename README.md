# PublicSoft Assignment
In this is a assignment-project we need to create a rest api using spring boot.
The api must have all CRUD methods plus a way to fetch specific data.

## Getting Started
It's very simple to run the application you hust need to follow the steps below.
1. Download the project
2. Unzip it
3. Import project to eclipse(Maven -> Existing Maven Project)
4. Run the class SpringRestH2Application as java application
!Keep in mind you need port 8080 for h2 database!
### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them.
You just need eclipse nothing else.

### How to test the functionality.
After you run the program you can check the database in the link below.
http://localhost:8080/h2\n
The EMPLOYEE table should be created automatic.\n
In this project i have used Swagger. Swagger makes it easy to work with the api endpoints.
All you have to do is go to: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html and clink on basic-rest-controller.\n
There you can use the api with ease(keep in mind that the ID fild is autoincrement so you dont have to type anything in it.
